# Meson
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/hashcloak/Meson.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/hashcloak/Meson)

This is the main repository related to the Meson project. 
Meson is a mixnet for cryptocurrency transactions. Meson is based on the [Katzenpost software project](https://katzenpost.mixnetworks.org/).

We have forked important parts of the Katzenpost mix network project in order to better compliment our upcoming changes and our cryptocurrency transaction usecase. Here are the places in which you can expect activity related to Meson's ongoing development:
- [Katzenmint](https://github.com/hashcloak/katzenmint-pki): An in-progress new PKI design for mix networks
- [Meson-server](https://github.com/hashcloak/Meson-server): Forked from the original Katzenpost server in which we make changes better suited for our Katzenmint PKI design and upcoming changes to how nodes (providers and mixes) will work in Meson.
- [Meson-client](https://github.com/hashcloak/Meson-client): Forked from the original Katzenpost client in which we make changes better suited for our Katzenmint PKI design and upcoming changes to how clients will work in Meson.
